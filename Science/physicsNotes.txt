1 - Measurement

1.1 - System Internationale Units (SI Units)

  Science uses the System Internationale (SI) system of units. The SI system is based on the fundamental units of:
    - Length : metre;
    - Mass   : kilogram;
    - Time   : second;
  More complex, derived units can be made from these fundamental units, for example:
    - Velocity     : ms^-1 (m/s);
    - Acceleration : ms^-2 (m/s^2);
    - Force        : kgms^-2 (kg*m/s^2);
  The SI system also uses the prefixes:
    - G : x10^9;
    - M : x10^6;
    - k : x10^3;
    - m : x10^-3;
    - µ : x10^-6;
    - n : x10^-9;
    
1.2 - Vectors and Scalars

    All measured quanities are either vectors or scalars. Scalars have magnitude (size) only, ut vectors have magnitude
  and direction in space. Scalars add and subtract like real numbers but direction must be take into account when
  adding or subtracting vectors. We can do this in one dimension by calling the vectors in one direction positive and
  vectors in the other direction negative.
  Examples of scalar quantities include:
    - Mass;
    - Temperature;
    - Energy;
    - Distance;
  Examples of vector quantities include:
    - Force;
    - Displacement;
    - Velocity;
    - Acceleration;
    
1.3 - Change

  We can find the change in a vectort or scalar quantity using the formula:
    - Change (Δ) = final amount - initial amount;


2 - Motion

2.1 - Motion Quantities

  Quantity         |  Symbol  |  Vector/Scalar  |     Units     |  Formula
                   |          |                 |               |
  Distance         |          |     Scalar      | m             |
  Speed            |          |     Scalar      | ms^-1 (m/s)   |
  Displacement     |     s    |     Vector      | m             |
  Velocity         |     v    |     Vector      | ms^-1 (m/s)   | v = Δs/Δt
  Acceleration     |     a    |     Vector      | ms^-2 (m/s^2) | a = Δv/t
  Initial Velocity |     u    |     Vector      | ms^-1 (m/s)   |
  Final Velocity   |     v    |     Vector      | ms^-1 (m/s)   | v = (v+u)/s
  
2.2 - Graphing Motion

    We can analyse motion by plotting displacement and velocity against time.
  For these graphs:
    - The gradient of a displacement against time graph is the velocity;
    - The gradient of a velocity against time graph is the acceleration;
    - The area under the velocity against time graph is the displacement;
    
2.3 - Equations of motion
  
  Galileo showed straight line motion with constanct velocity could be predicted using the equations:
    - s = (at^2)/2 + ut;
    - v = at + u;
    - v^2 = 2as + u^2 or v = sqrt(2as + u^2);
      

2.4 - Newtons Laws of Motion (Inertia)

  - An obect at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion at constanct velocity,
  unless acted upon by an unbalanced force;
  - A force is an action exerted on a body in order to change it's state either of rest or of uniform motion
  in a straight line.
  - Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in it's velocity;
  - The more mass an object has, the more inertia it has.

2.5 - Newtons Laws of Motion (Force)
  
  - The net force acting on an object is proporional jointly to the mass of the object and the resulting acceleration.
      F = ma
  - The net force of an object is equal to the product of it's mass and acceleration.
  - The unit of force is Newtons (N), or kgms^-2
  - Weight force: Weight is an objects mass * acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of all objects on Earth is ~9.6ms^-2.

2.6 - Newtons Laws of Motion (Reaction)

  - For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
      FA on B = -FB on A
  - There are always 2 forces: action and reaction forces.

2.7 - Universal Gravity

  - Every object with mass attracts every other object with mass.
  - Gravity:
    - increases as the mass of the objects increases.
    - decreases as the distance between the objects increases.
    F1 = F2 = G(m1 * m2) / r^2
  - G is the gravitational constant, 6.67e-11 Nm^2Kg^-2

2.8 - Centripetal Force

  - For an object to move with uniform circular motion a force must be applied to an object towards the centre of the circle.
  - This centripetal force is given by:
      Fc = mr^2r
  - For orbitting objects, gravity provides the centripetal force.
      Fc = Fg    v = sqrt(Gm / 4)


3 - Nuclear Physics

3.1 - The Atomic Nucleus

    Almost all the mass of an atom is contained in a tiny, positively charged nucleus, hence almost all of
  the atom is empty space.
    Atoms are made of these subatomic particles:
      + Protons   1.67*10^-27 kg  +1.6*10^-19 Coulombs;
      = Neutrons  1.67*10^-27 kg            0 Coulombs;
      - Electrons  9.1*10^-31 kg  -1.6*10^-19 Coulombs;
  Definitions:
    - Element: an atom with a specific number of protons in the nucleus;
    - Isotope: an element with a different number of nuetrons in the nucleus;
    - Radio-nuclide: an unstable (radioactive) nuclide (nucleus);
    - Nucleon: a proton or a neutron;
    - Atomic Number (z): number of protons in the nucleus;
    - Atomis Mass Number: number of nucleons in the nucleus;
  We represent nuclides as follows:
      A     e.g  238    
        X           U  represents a uranium nucleus with 146 nuetrons and 92 protons.
      Z           92

3.2 - Radioactivity

    If a nucleus is too big or contains the 'wrong'nuetron to proton ratio, it will be unstable and emit radioactive
  particles until it is transmuted into a stable nucleus. We call such nuclei radioisotopes.
    The three types of radioactive particles most commonly emmited are:
      - Alpha (α) is a helium nucleus (He^+2). They are highly ionising and consequently not very penetrating. They are
          stopped by just a few centimetres of air.
      - Beta (β) are high energy electrons emmited from particles with too many nuetrons (nuetrons change into a protons
          and emit an electron). Beta particles will pass through about 1 metre of air and are less ionising that alpha
          particles.
      - Gamma (γ) particles are photons of high frequency electromagnetic radiation. They are very penetraring and will
          pass though several centimeters of lead. Gamma are very poor ionisers.
    The rate at which radiation is emmitted is measured using half-life. The half-life is the time for half the atoms
  in a sample to undergo radioactive decay.

3.3 - Nuclear Energy

  In some reactions, mass is lost and energy released in accordance with Einstein's famous equation:
    E = mc^2 where:
      - E is energy in joules;
      - m is mass in kilograms;
      - c is 3*10^8 ms^-1, or the speed of light;
  Examples of nuclear reactions that release energy include:
    - Radioactivity: alpha, beta and gamma decay;
    - Nuclear fusion (joining): found in stars;
    - Nuclear fission (splitting): found at nuclear power stations;
      

4 - Waves

4.1 - Wave Properties

  We can classify waves as:
    Transverse waves: medium moves perpendicular to wave velocity (water, light, et cetera).
    Longitudinal waves: medium moves parallel to wave velocity (sound).
  Wavelength(λ): Distance between adjacent crests.
  Period(T): Time fot the oscillation.
  Frequencty(f): Number of cycles per second in Hertz.

4.2 - Electromagnetic Waves

    Micheal Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell showed that oscillating charges produced electromagnetic waves.
  The frequency of the wave was equal to the frequency of the oscillation that produced it.
    Electromagnetic waves consist of mutually perpendicular charging electric and magnetic fields and the
  range of frequencies over which they exist is called the electromagnetic spectrum.


5 - Cosmology

5.1 - Astrological Units

  - Astronomical unit (AU): the distance between the Earth and the Sun;
  - Parsec (pc): the distance that subtends an angle of 1 second of arc when observed at one
      Earth radius. Approximately 3.261 lightyears;
  - Magnitude: the scale used by astronomers to measure brightness. Small numbers refer to bright
      stars and large numbers refer to dull stars. Apparent magnitufe is how bright a star appears from
      Earth and absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear if it were located 10 pc from Earth.
  - Spectral class: used to measure temperature using colour. Uses letters O.B.A.F.G.K.M, with a range of
      90 between each letter. O is hot and blue, whilst M is cool and red. e.g. the Sun is approximately G2.
