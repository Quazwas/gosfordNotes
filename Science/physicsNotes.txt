4.2 - Electromagnetic Waves

  Micheal Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell ashowed that oscillating charges produced electromagnetic waves.
The frequency of the wave was equal to the frequency of the oscillation that produced it.
  Electromagnetic waves consist of mutually perpendicular charging electric and magnetic fields and the
range of frequencies over which they exist is called the electromagnetic spectrum.
