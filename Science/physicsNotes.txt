4.1 - Wave Properties

  We can classify waves as:
    Transverse waves: medium moves perpendicular to wave velocity (water, light, et cetera).
    Longitudinal waves: medium moves parallel to wave velocity (sound).
  Wavelength(Î»): Distance between adjacent crests.
  Period(T): Time fot the oscillation.
  Frequencty(f): Number of cycles per second in Hertz.

4.2 - Electromagnetic Waves

  Micheal Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell ashowed that oscillating charges produced electromagnetic waves.
The frequency of the wave was equal to the frequency of the oscillation that produced it.
  Electromagnetic waves consist of mutually perpendicular charging electric and magnetic fields and the
range of frequencies over which they exist is called the electromagnetic spectrum.
